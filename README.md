# WaveFormGenerator_AD9833
Simple waveform generator, using AD9833 + rotarty encoder + SSD1306 oled screen
You can build this project using either the arduino IDE or cmake-arduino (included).
In case of the latter, you'll probably need to tune the CMakeLists.txt

You'll also need the following dependencies :
* u8g2 (install it from arduino IDE)
* Bounce2 (install it from arduino IDE)
* Rotary encoder brilliant lib : https://github.com/brianlow/Rotary
* AD9833 lib Dhttps://github.com/Billwilliams1952/AD9833-Library-Arduino
